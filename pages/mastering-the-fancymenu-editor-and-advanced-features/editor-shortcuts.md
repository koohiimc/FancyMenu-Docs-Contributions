## Basic Keyboard Shortcuts

These essential keyboard shortcuts will help you perform everyday tasks in the FancyMenu Editor more quickly:

- **Copy Element:**  
  Press `Ctrl+C` to copy the selected element to your clipboard. This works with all types of elements, including text, buttons, images, and containers.

- **Paste Element:**  
  Press `Ctrl+V` to paste the copied element. This is useful for duplicating elements or moving them to a different part of the menu.

- **Select All Elements:**  
  Press `Ctrl+A` to select all elements on the current menu page. This is particularly useful when you want to move or modify all elements at once.

- **Undo Last Action:**  
  Press `Ctrl+Z` to undo the last action you performed. Whether you moved an element by mistake or deleted something, this will bring it back.

- **Redo Last Undone Action:**  
  Press `Ctrl+Y` to redo the action you just undone. This is helpful when you want to quickly reverse a decision after using the undo command.

## Proportional Resizing

To maintain the original aspect ratio of an image or element while resizing, use this handy tip:

- **Resize Elements Proportionally:**  
  Hold down the `Shift` key while dragging the corners of an image or element to resize it. This ensures that the element’s width and height stay in proportion, preventing distortion.

This is particularly useful for images and buttons where maintaining the correct aspect ratio is critical. For instance, you might use this technique to resize logos or icons without distorting their design.

## Anchoring Elements

Anchoring elements allows you to create dynamic, responsive layouts that adjust based on the position of other elements:

- **Copying and Using Anchor Points:**  
  1. Select an element you want to use as an anchor.  
  2. Copy its ID by right clicking the element.

  3. Go to the element you want to anchor and paste the copied ID into the **Anchor Point** field.

This links the second element’s position to the first element’s location. Moving or resizing the anchor element will cause the anchored element to adjust its position accordingly, making it a great way to ensure relative positioning between elements.

## Advanced Shortcuts for Productivity

These advanced shortcuts and tips will help you perform complex actions more efficiently:

- **Duplicate Element:**  
  Instead of manually creating similar elements, press `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V` to duplicate the selected element. This creates an identical copy that you can reposition or modify, saving you time when designing menus with repetitive elements.

- **Aligning Elements Correctly:**  
  Use the alignment tools in the right click menu to correctly align the elements. You can align them to the left, right, center, top, or bottom of the canvas using anchor points. You can use "Stay on Screen" option to restrict the element from going out of screen.

This is particularly helpful when you're working with multiple elements and want to make sure they are evenly spaced or aligned in a specific direction.

## Element Grouping and Layer Management

Efficiently managing multiple elements is key to a smooth design process. Here’s how you can do it:

- **Layer Management:**  
  The **Layer Management Panel** lets you organize your elements into different layers. You can bring elements to the front, send them to the back, or arrange them in layers to avoid cluttering the workspace.

Layers make it easier to edit complex menus by allowing you to isolate different sections of your design. If elements are overlapping, you can use the layer panel to select and adjust specific layers without affecting others.

- Clicking on white bar in top-right side of the screen to hide the menu bar at the top.
- Clicking red cross icon will exit the editor mode and allows you to see your creation.
