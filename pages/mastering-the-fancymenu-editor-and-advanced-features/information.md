## Advanced Layering  

Organize elements in your menu for complex designs using layers.

## Conditional Visibility  

Make menus dynamic by displaying elements based on requirements and placeholders.  

- **Setting Requirements:**  
  Right-click an element, select **Set Loading Requirement**, and specify the condition that needs to be met for the element to display.

- **Supported Placeholders:**  
  Placeholders can dynamically display information, such as `{"placeholder":"playername"}` or `{"placeholder":"fps"}`. Use these to create personalized and interactive menus.  

> Example: Below is a demonstration of conditional visibility using placeholders to display a welcome message with `{"placeholder":"playername"}`.

## Testing Your Designs  

Preview and debug your menus directly in the game without restarting:
- Clicking on white bar in top-right side of the screen to hide the menu bar at the top.
- Clicking red cross icon will exit the editor mode and allows you to see your creation.
