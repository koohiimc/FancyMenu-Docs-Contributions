# About

This repository is like a queue for user-generated documentation pages for [FancyMenu's docs](https://docs.fancymenu.net).

**I accept PRs here.**

If you want to write a page or pages, just send it as PR and if it's well-written, detailed and informative, I will add it to the actual docs later.

Please keep in mind that I will not add rushed, too short or uninformative pages, because otherwise the docs would become a confusing spam hell.

# Page Formatting

FancyMenu's documentation is formatted with Markdown, so you can use that in pages!

It's okay to use images, but no embedded videos please.

# Writing Documentation Pages for Money

If you‚Äôd like to contribute to the documentation on a paid basis, that‚Äôs absolutely fine! Simply send me a Discord DM (@keksuccino) to get started.

Since I can‚Äôt accept an unlimited amount of paid pages, it‚Äôs important to contact me first!

## Pay per Section

   - Payment starts at **$15 per section**.
   - The final amount will be decided after reviewing the section based on its length, detail, and quality.
   - For long and highly detailed sections, payment can go up to **$50 per section**.
   - Payment will be made via PayPal after the section is reviewed and approved.

## Scope and Sections

   - A section refers to a part of the documentation covering a specific feature or functionality, which might span multiple pages for clarity.
   - **Submit section topics for approval before starting via Discord DM**! This avoids writing sections that might be rejected.
   - You do **not** need to write 5 sections; this is simply the **maximum allowed at the start**. You can write fewer sections if preferred.
   - Avoid duplicating existing documentation; refer to the [FancyMenu Documentation](https://docs.fancymenu.net/) to ensure no redundancy.

## Workflow

   - After topics are approved, write your pages or sections and submit them as **Pull Requests (PRs)** to the [FancyMenu GitHub Repository for Contributions](https://github.com/Keksuccino/FancyMenu-Docs-Contributions). Work on the `main` branch unless otherwise instructed.
   - No strict deadlines, but consistent and steady progress is preferred.

## Quality Standards

   - Sections must be well-written, detailed, and helpful.
   - If a section does not meet expectations, it won‚Äôt be paid for, but prior topic approval reduces this risk.
